# How District Works

District is a tokenized lending protocol that bridges traditional finance with decentralized infrastructure, enabling global investors to participate in U.S. private credit markets through blockchain technology.

## The Three Core Components

### 1. DISTRICT Token — Vault Shares

DISTRICT is an ERC-7540 compliant vault token that represents your share of the lending pool. When you deposit USDC into the District vault, you receive DISTRICT tokens that:

- Represent proportional ownership of the vault's assets
- Accrue yield automatically as loans generate interest
- Can be redeemed for USDC (subject to liquidity)
- Are fully backed by real-world loan assets

**Key Characteristics:**
- Not a stablecoin—value fluctuates with vault performance
- Yield-bearing token that grows in value over time
- Transparent on-chain tracking of all holdings
- Redeemable through the vault's redemption process

### 2. Yield Generation — Senior Secured Loans

District generates yield by providing capital to carefully vetted Washington, D.C. area small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The yield comes from:

**Loan Structure:**
- **Loan Size**: $500K–$2M per loan
- **Interest Rate**: Target 13% APY to borrowers
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**: ≤ 50-70%
- **Collateral**: U.S. real estate and business assets
- **Recourse**: Full recourse to borrower and guarantors
- **Term**: Typically 12-36 months

**Yield Distribution:**
- Borrowers pay interest and principal to the vault
- Interest income is distributed to DISTRICT token holders
- Target net APY to depositors: 11-13% (after fees)

### 3. Capital Flow — The Complete Cycle
