# The Private Credit Market

Private credit has emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments of alternative investments, offering attractive risk-adjusted returns for institutional investors. District brings this institutional-grade asset class on-chain, making it accessible to a global audience.

## What is Private Credit?

Private credit refers to loans made by non-bank lenders to businesses. Unlike public debt markets, these loans are:

- **Privately negotiated** between lender and borrower
- **Customized** to specific business needs
- **Illiquid** but offering higher yields
- **Secured** by real assets and business cash flows
- **Senior** in the capital structure (first to be repaid)

## Market Size & Growth

The global private credit market has experienced explosive growth:

- **2023 Market Size**: $1.5+ trillion in assets under management
- **Growth Rate**: 15-20% annually over the past decade
- **Institutional Allocation**: Average 5-10% of portfolios
- **Projected 2030**: $2.8 trillion in AUM

### Why the Growth?

1. **Bank Retreat**: Post-2008 regulations reduced bank lending to SMBs
2. **Yield Premium**: 3-5% higher returns than comparable public debt
3. **Lower Volatility**: Less correlation with public markets
